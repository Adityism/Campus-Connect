## Getting Started

### Backend Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd campus-connect-ai/backend
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Install Ollama and Llama 3:**
   ```bash
   curl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
   ollama pull llama3
   ```
4. **(Optional) Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env as needed
   ```
5. **Run the backend server:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   # or for SSL:
   flask run --port=5001 --debug --cert=ssl/cert.pem --key=ssl/key.pem
   ```
6. **API Example:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/query \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"prompt": "tell me about UPES college india ?"}'
   ```

### Frontend Usage
1. Open `frontend/templates/index.html` or other HTML files in your browser.
2. Static assets (CSS, JS, images) are in `frontend/static/`.
3. For development, you may use a simple HTTP server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   python -m http.server 8000
   # Then visit http://localhost:8000/templates/index.html
   ```

**How to add `campusconnectkey.json`:**
1. Obtain the file from your Google Cloud Console (IAM & Admin > Service Accounts > Create Key).
2. Place it at `campus-connect-ai/backend/keys/campusconnectkey.json` (or as required by your code).
3. Never upload this file to GitHub or any public repository.
4. For deployment, use environment variables for credentials instead of a file.
